        <li>Create a new Angular project with Angular CLI.</li>
        <li>
          Install NgRx, Angular Material, Angular Fire. Use latest versions.
          Create a Firebase project, connect the Angular project to a Firebase
          project. Use Angular Material for the interface.
        </li>
        <li>Create a Material toolbar with two links: Home and Messages</li>
        <li>
          Create a lazy-loaded feature module and a component for the Messages
          page at /messages
        </li>
        <li>
          On the Messages page create a material button. This button should open
          a material dialog with the form. Form has two text fields: one line
          text field: Name, multi-line text field Message and a Submit button.
          Also add a Material icon close button in the top corner.
        </li>

        <li>
          This form when submitted should add a document to a Firestore
          collection 'messages' with an autogenerated ID. Submission has to be
          implemented with NgRx. Errors has to be handled with NgRx as well
          (Separate actions for the request success and failure). Show loading
          spinner while the form is being submitted / loading. Show material
          Snack bar to notify the user about the outcome of the operation.
        </li>
        <li>
          The page /messages should show all of the documents in the 'messages'
          collection in a Material Table sorted chronologically. The table
          columns are: ID, Name, Message (trimmed to 100 characters), Date
          (formatted). Loading messages needs to be implemented with NgRx as
          well. Show a loading spinner when the messages are loading.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Feel free to interpret it the way you think is the most user-friendly.
        Try to make it aesthetically pleasing as much as possible. Please upload
        the completed project to Firebase hosting or Vercel and share the GitHub
        repo so I could see your code quality.
